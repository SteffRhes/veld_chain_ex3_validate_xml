A chain that uses a single **data veld** as input, and a validation **excutable veld**. The other
input (a schema.xsd), and the output (a simple txt file for humans), are persisted directly into
this chain.

This example shows the flexibility of **chain velds**. They should reuse **date velds** and
**executable velds**, where possible, but they don't have to. In a chain you can define data, input,
output, even code yourself freely.
